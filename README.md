# Multiple Myeloma Dataset

First and foremost, thanks for you interest in using our dataset with labeled cells design to supporting the detecting Plasma Cells.

This repository contains images of different cells, including Plasma ones, collected from histological slides of bone marrow aspirate stained with Wright-Giem. Moreover, we also shared a Deep Neural Network trained to help with the diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma (MM), a plasma cell oncohematology with the highest incidence, being more frequent in individuals over 50 years old. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2020, MM was responsible for 176,404 new cases and 117,077 deaths of patients of both sexes.
